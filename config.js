I help busy professionals and families find homes that truly fit their lives, while working behind the scenes to make real estate better for everyone involved. With a background in risk management, I bring a strategic lens to every transaction, ensuring my clients make informed, confident decisions. I‚Äôm also the co-founder of Jazzberry, a platform designed by realtors, for realtors, built to simplify the chaos behind the curtain so clients experience more clarity, transparency, and joy in their home journey. A proud Maritimer, I lead with authenticity, hospitality, and heart. Whether I‚Äôm running along the Bow River, adventuring in the mountains with my family, or hosting FutureRE ‚Äî The Future of Real Estate, I‚Äôm always driven by curiosity, connection, and impact. My path hasn‚Äôt been linear ‚Äî and I believe that‚Äôs where the magic lies. I‚Äôm here to challenge the status quo, build solutions that truly help people, and give back to the communities that raised me ‚Äî especially organizations that uplift women, children, and families.",
