    "bio": "A former risk manager turned Realtor, proptech co-founder, podcast host, and passionate community advocate. I help busy professionals and families find homes that truly fit their lives, while working behind the scenes to make real estate better for everyone involved. With a background in risk management, I bring a strategic lens to every transaction, ensuring my clients make informed, confident decisions. I’m also the co-founder of Jazzberry, a platform designed by realtors, for realtors, built to simplify the chaos behind the curtain so clients experience more clarity, transparency, and joy in their home journey. A proud Maritimer, I lead with authenticity, hospitality, and heart. Whether I’m running along the Bow River, adventuring in the mountains with my family, or hosting FutureRE — The Future of Real Estate, I’m always driven by curiosity, connection, and impact. My path hasn’t been linear — and I believe that’s where the magic lies. I’m here to challenge the status quo, build solutions that truly help people, and give back to the communities that raised me — especially organizations that uplift women, children, and families.",
